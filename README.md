# Inkai

A simple tool that helps you build off-line spreadsheet-based collectors for your database. Inspired by Open Data Kit (https://github.com/getodk)

Hi! If you have ever used a spreadsheet (as Excel or Calc) as an input tool for a database you may be interested in Inkai. I have faced this problem several times as a Research Software Engineer, and I know many of you also have. Writing a specific database application with this purpose is annoying so I started this project. Hope you find it useful.

Inkai is made out of two tools: one generates a spreadsheet template from a database and a number of questions; the second feed a database from a spreadsheet file that has been generated with the first tool.
